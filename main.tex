Adam Krajewski was born in Europe, where he spent his childhood and received pre-college education at a public school nationally recognized for its university-level chemistry curriculum. He first came to the United States in 2013 and moved entirely in 2015, joining the Materials Science and Engineering Department at Case Western Reserve University. Within the first two months of enrollment, he began research in Prof. Welsch's group, and started to take graduate courses in his sophomore year. Around the same time, he joined Prof. Willard's group, progressively moving from experiments towards theory, modeling, and simulations. In late 2016, he enrolled in graduate courses in Artificial Intelligence and specialize in applying Machine Learning to his research problems in Materials Science. 

After earning his B.S.E. degree in 2019, he moved directly to pursue PhD at Penn State under world-renowned thermodynamics expert Prof. Zi-Kui Liu and had the pleasure of working on implementing a variety of computational techniques, including machine learning, while having the support of colleagues who are specialists in ab-initio modeling, thermodynamic calculations, and materials discovery. Since 2022, he also extensively collaborated with LLNL and have spent two summers on-site at the lab.
