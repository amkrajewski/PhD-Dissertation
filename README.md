## Abstract

The true power of computational research typically can lay in either what it accomplishes or what it enables others to accomplish. In this work, both avenues are simultaneously embraced across several distinct efforts existing at three general scales of abstractions of what a material is - atomistic, physical, and design. At each, an efficient materials informatics infrastructure is being built from the ground up based on (1) the fundamental understanding of the underlying prior knowledge, including the data, (2) deployment routes that take advantage of it, and (3) pathways to extend it in an autonomous or semi-autonomous fashion, while heavily relying on artificial intelligence (AI) to guide well-established DFT-based ab initio and CALPHAD-based thermodynamic methods.

The resulting multi-level discovery infrastructure is highly generalizable as it focuses on encoding problems to solve them easily rather than looking for an existing solution. To showcase it, this dissertation discusses the design of multi-alloy functionally graded materials (FGMs) incorporating ultra-high temperature refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) towards gas turbine and jet engine efficiency increase reducing $CO_2$ emissions, as well as hypersonic vehicles. It leverages a new graph representation of underlying mathematical space using a newly developed algorithm based on combinatorics, not subject to many problems troubling the community. Underneath, property models and phase relations are learned from optimized samplings of the largest and highest quality dataset of HEA in the world, called ULTERA. At the atomistic level, a data ecosystem optimized for machine learning (ML) from over 4.5 million relaxed structures, called MPDD, is used to inform experimental observations and improve thermodynamic models by providing stability data enabled by a new efficient featurization framework.

## Vita 

Adam Krajewski was born in Europe, where he spent his childhood and received pre-college education at a school nationally recognized for its university-level chemistry curriculum. He first came to the United States in 2013 and moved completely in 2015 to join the Materials Science Department at Case Western Reserve University. Within the first two months, Adam began research in Prof. Welsch's group. After just one year, he enrolled in graduate courses and also joined Prof. Willard's group, progressively moving from experiments towards theory, modeling, and simulations. In the Fall of 2017, he enrolled in graduate courses in Artificial Intelligence, starting to specialize in applying AI techniques, including Machine Learning, to his research which became focused hidden process modeling, materials data processing, and data-driven design of magnetocaloric metallic glasses.

After earning his B.S.E. degree in 2019, Adam moved directly to pursue PhD under world-renowned thermodynamics expert Prof. Zi-Kui Liu at Penn State. He had the pleasure of working on implementing various computational techniques, ranging from atomistic machine learning through materials data curation, to purely theoretical considerations, while having the support of colleagues who are specialists in applied ab-initio modeling, thermodynamic calculations, and materials discovery. Since 2022, he has also extensively collaborated with Lawrence Livermore National Lab, where he spent two summers on-site.

As of May 2024, Adam has published several computational tools and scientific publications listed under his ORCID record [0000-0002-2266-0099](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2266-0099) and Google Scholar (id:[3tvHo8kAAAAJ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3tvHo8kAAAAJ) including 4 first-author publications and 9 co-author publications. Furthermore, eight first-author papers are under preparation.
