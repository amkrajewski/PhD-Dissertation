This chapter adapts parts of a manuscript draft planned for future publication, co-authored with Arindam Debnath, Shuang Lin, Alexander Richter, Ricardo Amaral, Wesley F. Reinhart, Allison M. Beese, and Zi-Kui Liu. All of included text was written by Adam M. Krajewski. Described software has been developed by Adam M. Krajewski extending \texttt{nimplex} described in Chapter \ref{chap:nimplex} and used to generate results employing thermodynamic models developed by Shuang Lin. All other authors provided edits and guidance.

    \caption{Feasibility map over compositional tetrahedron (3-simplex) formed by all combinations of Ti50 Zr50, Hf95 Ti5, Mo33 Nb33 Ta33, Mo80 Nb10 W10 discretized at 12 divisions per dimension. The positions in the 7-component elemental space obtained from \texttt{nimplex}, described in Chapter \ref{chap:nimplex}, were used to run \texttt{pycalphad} \cite{Otis2017Pycalphad:Python} evaluations and constrained by limiting phases present at equilibrium at 1000K to single or many solid solution phases. Roughly half of the compositions are infeasible with most of them forming a single large region.}

    \caption{A view of ternary Cr-Nb-W phase diagram projected across a temperature range of phase classes, further augmented by imposing predicted property value constraints. It depicts the smoothness of the infeasible region boundary (red) and increasingly smooth boundary of property-constrained region.

    \caption{The same problem as in Figure \ref{infeasibilitygliding:fig:fullcomputation} solved by iteratively exploring all feasible paths in the compositional graph in depth-first approach, which can be started from one or multiple points, and terminated once goal is reached or once all of the feasible space is explored.}
