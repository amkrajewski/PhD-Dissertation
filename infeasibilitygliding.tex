    \caption{Feasibility map over compositional tetrahedron (3-simplex) formed by all combinations of Ti50 Zr50, Hf95 Ti5, Mo33 Nb33 Ta33, Mo80 Nb10 W10 discretized at 12 divisions per dimension. The positions in the 7-component elemental space obtained from \texttt{nimplex}, described in Chapter \ref{chap:nimplex}, were used to run \texttt{pycalphad} \cite{Otis2017Pycalphad:Python} evaluations and constrained by limiting phases present at equilibrium at 1000K to single or many solid solution phases. Roughly half of the compositions are infeasible with most of them forming a single large region.}

    \caption{A view of ternary Cr-Nb-W phase diagram projected across a temperature range of phase classes, further augmented by imposing predicted property value constraints. It depicts the smoothness of the infeasible region boundary (red) and increasingly smooth boundary of property-constrained region.
