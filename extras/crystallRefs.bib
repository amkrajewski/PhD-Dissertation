JARVIS is motivated by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) principles of developing open-access databases and tools to reduce the cost and development time of materials discovery, optimization, and deployment. The major features of JARVIS are: JARVIS-DFT, JARVIS-FF, JARVIS-ML, and JARVIS-tools. To date, JARVIS consists of ≈40,000 materials and ≈1 million calculated properties in JARVIS-DFT, ≈500 materials and ≈110 force-fields in JARVIS-FF, and ≈25 ML models for material-property predictions in JARVIS-ML, all of which are continuously expanding. JARVIS-tools provides scripts and workflows for running and analyzing various simulations. We compare our computational data to experiments or high-fidelity computational methods wherever applicable to evaluate error/uncertainty in predictions. In addition to the existing workflows, the infrastructure can support a wide variety of other technologically important applications as part of the data-driven materials design paradigm.

Here, we shed light on the forming mechanism of equilibrium and non-equilibrium intermetallic compounds (IMCs) in dissimilar aluminum/steel joints with respect to processing history (e.g., the pressure and temperature profiles) and chemical composition, where the knowledge of free energy and atomic diffusion in the Al–Fe system was taken from first-principles phonon calculations and data available in the literature. We found that the metastable and ductile (judged by the presently predicted elastic constants) Al <sub>6</sub> Fe is a pressure ( <italic>P</italic> ) favored IMC observed in processes involving high pressures. The MoSi <sub>2</sub> -type Al <sub>2</sub> Fe is brittle and a strong <italic>P</italic> -favored IMC observed at high pressures. The stable, brittle η-Al <sub>5</sub> Fe <sub>2</sub> is the most observed IMC (followed by θ-Al <sub>13</sub> Fe <sub>4</sub> ) in almost all processes, such as fusion/solid-state welding and additive manufacturing (AM), since η-Al <sub>5</sub> Fe <sub>2</sub> is temperature-favored, possessing high thermodynamic driving force of formation and the fastest atomic diffusivity among all Al–Fe IMCs. Notably, the ductile AlFe <sub>3</sub> , the less ductile AlFe, and most of the other IMCs can be formed during AM, making AM a superior process to achieve desired IMCs in dissimilar materials. In addition, the unknown configurations of Al <sub>2</sub> Fe and Al <sub>5</sub> Fe <sub>2</sub> were also examined by machine learning based datamining together with first-principles verifications and structure predictions. All the IMCs that are not <italic>P-</italic> favored can be identified using the conventional equilibrium phase diagram and the Scheil-Gulliver non-equilibrium simulations. </p>},

The electromotive force (emf) of Nd-Bi alloys in molten LiCl-KCl-NdCl3 at 773–973 K was measured via coulometric titration of Nd into Bi for the determination of thermochemical properties such as activity coefficients and solubilities of Nd in Bi.

The unknown crystal structure of NdBi2 was suggested to be a mixture of the anti-La2Sb configuration and the La2Te-type configuration based on ML predictions for over 26,000 data-mined AB2-type configurations together with DFT-based verifications.

   abstract = {In the present paper, we introduce a new neural network-based tool for the prediction of formation energies of atomic structures based on elemental and structural features of Voronoi-tessellated materials. We provide a concise overview of the connection between the machine learning and the true material–property relationship, how to improve the generalization accuracy by reducing overfitting, how new data can be incorporated into the model to tune it to a specific material system, and preliminary results on using models to preform local structure relaxations. The present work resulted in three final models optimized for (1) highest test accuracy on the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), (2) performance in the discovery of new materials, and (3) performance at a low computational cost. On a test set of 21,800 compounds randomly selected from OQMD, they achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 28, 40, and 42 meV/atom, respectively. The second model provides better predictions in a test case of interest not present in the OQMD, while the third reduces the computational cost by a factor of 8. We collect our results in a new open-source tool called SIPFENN (Structure-Informed Prediction of Formation Energy using Neural Networks). SIPFENN not only improves the accuracy beyond existing models but also ships in a ready-to-use form with pre-trained neural networks and a GUI interface. By virtue of this, it can be included in DFT calculations routines at nearly no cost.},

While most existing GNN models for atomistic predictions are based on atomic distance information, they do not explicitly incorporate bond angles, which are critical for distinguishing many atomic structures. Furthermore, many material properties are known to be sensitive to slight changes in bond angles. We present an Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN), a GNN architecture that performs message passing on both the interatomic bond graph and its line graph corresponding to bond angles. We demonstrate that angle information can be explicitly and efficiently included, leading to improved performance on multiple atomistic prediction tasks. We ALIGNN models for predicting 52 solid-state and molecular properties available in the JARVIS-DFT, Materials project, and QM9 databases.

The method is based on a Monte Carlo simulated annealing loop with an objective function that seeks to perfectly match the maximum number of correlation functions (as opposed to merely minimizing the distance between the SQS correlation and the disordered state correlations for a pre-specified set of correlations). The proposed method optimizes the shape of the supercell jointly with the occupation of the atomic sites, thus ensuring that the configurational space searched is exhaustive and not biased by a pre-specified supercell shape. The method has been implemented in the "mcsqs" code of the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) in the most general framework of multicomponent multisublattice systems and in a way that minimizes the amount of input information the user needs to specify and that allows for efficient parallelization.},

   abstract = {Novel functional materials enable fundamental breakthroughs across technological applications from clean energy to information processing 1-11. From microchips to batteries and photovoltaics, discovery of inorganic crystals has been bottlenecked by expensive trial-and-error approaches. Concurrently, deep-learning models for language, vision and biology have showcased emergent predictive capabilities with increasing data and computation 12-14. Here we show that graph networks trained at scale can reach unprecedented levels of generalization, improving the efficiency of materials discovery by an order of magnitude. Building on 48,000 stable crystals identified in continuing studies 15-17 , improved efficiency enables the discovery of 2.2 million structures below the current convex hull, many of which escaped previous human chemical intuition. Our work represents an order-of-magnitude expansion in stable materials known to humanity. Stable discoveries that are on the final convex hull will be made available to screen for technological applications, as we demonstrate for layered materials and solid-electrolyte candidates. Of the stable structures, 736 have already been independently experimentally realized. The scale and diversity of hundreds of millions of first-principles calculations also unlock modelling capabilities for downstream applications, leading in particular to highly accurate and robust learned interatomic potentials that can be used in condensed-phase molecular-dynamics simulations and high-fidelity zero-shot prediction of ionic conductivity. The discovery of energetically favourable inorganic crystals is of fundamental scientific and technological interest in solid-state chemistry. Experimental approaches over the decades have catalogued 20,000 computationally stable structures (out of a total of 200,000 entries) in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) 15,18. However, this strategy is impractical to scale owing to costs, throughput and synthesis complications 19. Instead, computational approaches championed by the Materials Project (MP) 16 , the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) 17 , AFLOWLIB 20 and NOMAD 21 have used first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) as approximations of physical energies. Combining ab initio calculations with simple substitutions has allowed researchers to improve to 48,000 computa-tionally stable materials according to our own recalculations 22-24 (see Methods). Although data-driven methods that aid in further materials discovery have been pursued, thus far, machine-learning techniques have been ineffective in estimating stability (decomposition energy) with respect to the convex hull of energies from competing phases 25. In this paper, we scale up machine learning for materials exploration through large-scale active learning, yielding the first models that accurately predict stability and, therefore, can guide materials discovery. Our approach relies on two pillars: first, we establish methods for generating diverse candidate structures, including new symmetry-aware partial substitutions (SAPS) and random structure search 26. Second, we use state-of-the art graph neural networks (GNNs) that improve modelling of material properties given structure or composition. In a series of rounds, these graph networks for materials exploration (GNoME) are trained on available data and used to filter candidate structures. The energy of the filtered candidates is computed using DFT, both verifying model predictions and serving as a data flywheel to train more robust models on larger datasets in the next round of active learning. Through this iterative procedure, GNoME models have discovered more than 2.2 million structures stable with respect to previous work, in particular agglomerated datasets encompassing computational and experimental structures 15-17,27. Given that discovered materials compete for stability, the updated convex hull consists of 381,000 new entries for a total of 421,000 stable crystals, representing an-order-of-magnitude expansion from all previous discoveries. Consistent with observations in other domains of machine learning 28 , we observe that our neural networks predictions improve as a power law with the amount of data. Final GNoME models accurately predict energies to 11 meV atom −1 and improve the precision of stable predictions (hit rate) to above 80% with structure and 33% per 100 trials with composition only, compared with 1% in previous work 17. Moreover, these networks develop emergent out-of-distribution generalization. For example, GNoME enables accurate predictions of structures with 5+ unique elements (despite omission from training), providing one of the first strategies to efficiently explore this chemical space. We validate findings by comparing predictions with experiments and higher-fidelity r 2 SCAN (ref. 29) computations. Finally, we demonstrate that the dataset produced in GNoME discovery unlocks new modelling capabilities for downstream applications. The structures and relaxation trajectories present a large and diverse dataset to enable training of learned, equivariant interatomic potentials 30,31 with unprecedented accuracy and zero-shot generalization.},

These tools are based on the Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) formalism, extended to transparently handle, not only traditional fcc, bcc and hcp solid solutions, but also multiple-sublattice structures with possible sublattice disorder. A large database of pre-generated SQS is provided that covers over 30 of the most common multi-sublattice structures and spans the composition ranges of each of their sublattices. In addition, we exploit a theoretically justified and robust method to address the issue of assigning free energies to mechanically unstable “virtual” phases, thus providing a compelling solution to a long-standing problem in CALPHAD modeling, especially in the context of ab initio data. We also propose a simple low-order approximation scheme to include short-range order effects that requires no additional ab initio input. The resulting thermodyamic database seamlessly combines ab initio data (formation energies and, optionally, vibrational free energies) with elemental Scientific Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE) data. The proposed tools provide a clear path to expand the coverage of high-throughput efforts towards non-stoichiometric phases and non-zero temperatures. The generated free energy models can also provide very good starting points to perform complex thermodynamic assessments, especially in cases where the available experimental data poorly constrain some thermodynamic parameters.

   abstract = {We propose an efficient high-throughput scheme for the discovery of stable crystalline phases. Our approach is based on the transmutation of known compounds, through the substitution of atoms in the crystal structure with chemically similar ones. The concept of similarity is defined quantitatively using a measure of chemical replaceability, extracted by data-mining experimental databases. In this way we build 189,981 possible crystal phases, including 18,479 that are on the convex hull of stability. The resulting success rate of 9.72% is at least one order of magnitude better than the usual success rate of systematic high-throughput calculations for a specific family of materials, and comparable with speed-up factors of machine learning filtering procedures. As a characterization of the set of 18,479 stable compounds, we calculate their electronic band gaps, magnetic moments, and hardness. Our approach, that can be used as a filter on top of any high-throughput scheme, enables us to efficiently extract stable compounds from tremendously large initial sets, without any initial assumption on their crystal structures or chemical compositions.},

Hypothetical (as well as known structure) models for binary compounds are produced with exclusive connection of polyhedra by corners, such as [MX 3] triangles in M2X3 formulation, [MX 4] tetrahedra in MX2 (zeolites or dense SiO2 polymorphs), [MX5] polyhedra in M2X5, and finally [MX6] octahedra in MX3 polymorphs. Moreover, hypothetical ternary compounds are built up by combinations of either two different polyhedra or two different radii for two different cations adopting the same coordination. The cost function is based on the agreement of the model interatomic distances with ideal distances provided by the user. The Monte Carlo algorithm first finds structure candidates selected after the verification of the expected geometry, and then optimizes the cell parameters and the atomic coordinates. A satellite software (GRINS) uses the predicted models and produces the characteristics of isostructural compounds which would be obtained by cationic substitutions.

   abstract = {It has been observed in both natural and man-made materials that volume sometimes decreases with increasing temperature. Though mechanistic understanding has been gained for some individual materials, a general answer to the question ''Why does volume sometimes decrease with the increase of temperature?'' remains lacking. Based on the thermodynamic relation that the derivative of volume with respect to temperature, i.e., thermal expansion, is equal to the negative derivative of entropy with respect to pressure, we developed a general theory in terms of multiscale entropy to understand and predict the change of volume as a function of temperature, which is termed as zentropy theory in the present work. It is shown that a phase at high temperatures is a statistical representation of the ground-state stable and multiple nonground-state metastable configurations. It is demonstrated that when the volumes of the nonground-state configurations with high probabilities are smaller than that of the ground-state configuration, the volume of the phase may decrease with the increase of temperature in certain ranges of temperature-pressure combinations, depicting the negative divergency of thermal expansion at the critical point. As examples, positive and negative divergencies of thermal expansion are predicted at the critical points of Ce and Fe 3 Pt, respectively, along with the temperature and pressure ranges for abnormally positive and negative thermal expansions. The authors believe that the zentropy theory is applicable to predict anomalies of other physical properties of phases because the change of entropy drives the responses of a system to external stimuli.},

The (Pd, M, Zn) $\gamma$-brass phase enables the controlled synthesis of Pd–M–Pd catalytic sites (M = Zn, Pd, Cu, Ag and Au) isolated in an inert Zn matrix. These multi-atom heteronuclear active sites are catalytically distinct from Pd single atoms and fully coordinated Pd. Here we quantify the unexpectedly large effect that active-site composition (that is, identity of the M atom in Pd–M–Pd sites) has on ethylene selectivity during acetylene semihydrogenation. Subtle stoichiometric control demonstrates that Pd–Pd–Pd sites are active for ethylene hydrogenation, whereas Pd–Zn–Pd sites show no measurable ethylene-to-ethane conversion. Agreement between experimental and density-functional-theory-predicted activities and selectivities demonstrates precise control of Pd–M–Pd active-site composition. This work demonstrates that the diversity and well-defined structure of intermetallics can be used to design active sites assembled with atomic-level precision. Advances in the design of heterogeneous catalysts are limited by our ability to synthesize atomically precise active-site ensembles. Now, the controlled synthesis of Pd–M–Pd catalytic sites (M = Zn, Pd, Cu, Ag and Au) has been demonstrated. Stoichiometric control identifies that Pd–Pd–Pd sites are active for ethylene hydrogenation, whereas Pd–Zn–Pd sites are not.},

In this work, Ru and Ru-Zn catalysts supported on hydroxyapatite (HAP), which is nontoxic and abundant in nature, were prepared via the simple ion-exchange method. The catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption methods. The influences of Ru/Zn molar ratio, reaction temperature, pressure, reaction time, and amount of modifier NaOH on the partial hydrogenation of benzene were studied in detail. It was demonstrated that metallic nanoparticles of less than 2 nm were dispersed uniformly on the surface of the HAP, and the bimetallic Ru-Zn/HAP catalysts showed high activity and selectivity. The yield of cyclohexene could reach 33% over Ru-Zn/HAP at the optimized conditions, and the catalyst could be reused at least four times without obvious loss of the activity and selectivity. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Measurements of the e.m.f.'s E yielded the Gibbs enthalpies $\Delta$Gr, using the relation $\Delta$Gr = -nFE. From the temperature dependence of E, $\Delta$Sr and $\Delta$Hr were also obtained. Additionally, $\Delta$Hr298 was measured by solution calorimetry. The most important result is that the formation of the elpasolites according to the equation ACl + A2LaCl5 = A3LaCl6 is associated with a loss of lattice enthalpy compensated by a high gain in entropy. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

   abstract = {| www.nature.com/naturenanotechnology 235 G raphene is the two-dimensional building block for sp 2 carbon allotropes of every other dimensionality. It can be stacked into three-dimensional graphite, rolled into one-dimensional nanotubes, or wrapped into zero-dimensional fuller-enes. It is at the centre of an ever-expanding research area 1-5. Near-ballistic transport and high mobility make it an ideal material for nanoelectronics, especially for high-frequency applications 6. Furthermore, its optical and mechanical properties are ideal for micro-and nanomechanical systems, thin-film transistors , transparent and conductive composites and electrodes, flexible and printable (opto)electronics, and photonics 2-4,7,8. An ideal characterization tool should be fast and non-destructive , offer high resolution, give structural and electronic information , and be applicable at both laboratory and mass-production scales. Raman spectroscopy 9,10 fulfils all these requirements. The Raman spectrum of graphite was first recorded more than 40 years ago 11 and, by the time the Raman spectrum of graphene was first measured in 2006 12 , Raman spectroscopy had become one of the most popular techniques for the characterization of disordered and amorphous carbons, fullerenes, nanotubes, diamonds, carbon chains and polyconjugated molecules 13. Raman techniques are particularly useful for graphene 14 because the absence of a band-gap makes all wavelengths of incident radiation resonant, thus the Raman spectrum contains information about both atomic structure and electronic properties. Resonance could also be reached by ultraviolet excitation 15,16 , either with the M-point Van Hove singularity or in the case of bandgap opening, such as in fluorinated graphene. The number of graphene layers (N) in a sample can be determined by elastic light scattering (Rayleigh) spectroscopy 17,18 , but this approach only works for exfoliated samples on optimized substrates and does not provide other structural or electronic information. Raman spectroscopy, on the other hand, works for all graphene samples 12,14. Moreover, it is able to identify unwanted by-products, structural damage, functional groups and chemical modifications introduced during the preparation, processing or placement of graphene 5. As a result, a Raman spectrum is invaluable for quality control, and for comparing samples used by different research groups. Raman spectroscopy is an integral part of graphene research. It is used to determine the number and orientation of layers, the quality and types of edge, and the effects of perturbations, such as electric and magnetic fields, strain, doping, disorder and functional groups. This, in turn, provides insight into all sp 2-bonded carbon allotropes, because graphene is their fundamental building block. Here we review the state of the art, future directions and open questions in Raman spectroscopy of graphene. We describe essential physical processes whose importance has only recently been recognized, such as the various types of resonance at play, and the role of quantum interference. We update all basic concepts and notations, and propose a terminology that is able to describe any result in literature. We finally highlight the potential of Raman spectroscopy for layered materials other than graphene. The toll for the simplicity of Raman measurements is paid when it comes to data interpretation. The spectra of all carbon-based materials show only a few prominent features, regardless of the final structure 13. However, the shapes, intensities and positions of these peaks give a considerable amount of information, often comparable to that obtained by competing techniques that are more complicated and destructive 13. For example, Raman spectroscopy can distinguish between a hard amorphous carbon, a metallic nanotube or a doped graphene sample 14. In the past six years, there has been a significant step forward in the understanding of Raman spectroscopy in graphene, fuelled by new results on doping 19-27 , edges 28-33 , strain and stress 34-40 , disorder 14,33,41-43 , oxidation 44 , hydrogenation 45 , chemical func-tionalization 46 , electrical mobility 47,48 , thermal conductivity 49,50 , electron-phonon 41,50-55 and electron-electron 51,53,54,56,57 interactions , magnetic field 58-67 and interlayer coupling 68-72. As a result, the understanding of the basic Raman processes has changed. Raman scattering on phonons is to a large extent determined by electrons: how they move, interfere and scatter. Thus, any variation of electronic properties due to defects, edges, doping or magnetic fields affects positions, widths and intensities of the Raman peaks, enabling one to probe electrons via phonons. Quantum interference effects 20,52,73 play a key role, and they can also be investigated by this technique. Here we review these new developments, and incorporate them into a general framework for Raman spectroscopy in gra-phene based on a unified and self-consistent terminology. We introduce the basic physics of Raman spectroscopy in graphene, and discuss the effects of edges, layers, defects and disorder, and perturbations. We outline the history of the field, interference 74,75 and surface-enhanced 76 Raman scattering in the Supplementary Information (Sections S4, S2 and S3, respectively), along with the effects of polarization (Supplementary Section S5), electric fields and doping (Supplementary Section S6), magnetic field (Supplementary Section S7), uniaxial and biaxial strain (Supplementary Section S8), temperature (Supplementary Section S9), isotopes (Supplementary Section S10) and other examples (Supplementary Section S11).

The r2SCAN revision of the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) balances numerical stability with high general accuracy. To assess the r2SCAN description of solid-state thermodynamics, we evaluate the formation and decomposition enthalpies, equilibrium volumes, and fundamental band gaps of more than 1000 solids using r2SCAN, SCAN, and PBE, as well as two dispersion-corrected variants, SCAN+rVV10 and r2SCAN+rVV10. We show that r2SCAN achieves accuracy comparable to SCAN and often improves upon SCAN’s already excellent accuracy. Although SCAN+rVV10 is often observed to worsen the formation enthalpies of SCAN and makes no substantial correction to SCAN’s cell volume predictions, r2SCAN+rVV10 predicts marginally less accurate formation enthalpies than r2SCAN, and slightly more accurate cell volumes than r2SCAN. The average absolute errors in predicted formation enthalpies are found to decrease by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5 from the GGA level to the meta-GGA level. Smaller decreases in error are observed for decomposition enthalpies. For formation enthalpies r2SCAN improves over SCAN for intermetallic systems. For a few classes of systems─transition metals, intermetallics, weakly bound solids, and enthalpies of decomposition into compounds─GGAs are comparable to meta-GGAs. In total, r2SCAN and r2SCAN+rVV10 can be recommended as stable, general-purpose meta-GGAs for materials discovery.},

Included in the set is a new electrostatic principle which is of wide application and considerable power. It is shown that the known structures of many complex crystals, in particular the complex silicates, satisfy the requirements of these principles. As an illustration of the application of the principles in the prediction of structures with the coördination theory, some properties of the structures of the three forms of Al2SiO5, cyanite, andalusite and sillimanite, are predicted. It is further shown that the theory requires that no stable basic silicates of divalent metals exist, and that in aluminum silicates of alkali metals there should be at least one aluminum ion for every alkali ion. The structures of aluminum silicates of divalent metals which are simplest from the coördination standpoint are shown to correspond to the formulas R3++Al2Si3O12 and R3++Al2Si6O18, which include the most important minerals of this class, the garnets and beryl. © 1929, American Chemical Society.

@article{Pickard2011,
   abstract = {It is essential to know the arrangement of the atoms in a material in order to compute and understand its properties. Searching for stable structures of materials using first-principles electronic structure methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), is a rapidly growing field. Here we describe our simple, elegant and powerful approach to searching for structures with DFT which we call ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS). Applications to discovering structures of solids, point defects, surfaces, and clusters are reviewed. New results for iron clusters on graphene, silicon clusters, polymeric nitrogen, hydrogen-rich lithium hydrides, and boron are presented.},

@article{Ferreira2023,
   abstract = { Motivated by the recent report of room-temperature superconductivity at near-ambient pressure in N-doped lutetium hydride, we performed a comprehensive, detailed study of the phase diagram of the Lu–N–H system, looking for superconducting phases. We combined ab initio crystal structure prediction with ephemeral data-derived interatomic potentials to sample over 200,000 different structures. Out of the more than 150 structures predicted to be metastable within ~50 meV from the convex hull we identify 52 viable candidates for conventional superconductivity, for which we computed their superconducting properties from Density Functional Perturbation Theory. Although for some of these structures we do predict a finite superconducting T c , none is even remotely compatible with room-temperature superconductivity as reported by Dasenbrock et al. Our work joins the broader community effort that has followed the report of near-ambient superconductivity, confirming beyond reasonable doubt that no conventional mechanism can explain the reported T c in Lu–N–H. },

@article{Shumailov2023,
   abstract = {Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-\{n\} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as Model Collapse and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.},

@article{Alemohammad2023,
   abstract = {Seismic advances in generative AI algorithms for imagery, text, and other data types has led to the temptation to use synthetic data to train next-generation models. Repeating this process creates an autophagous (self-consuming) loop whose properties are poorly understood. We conduct a thorough analytical and empirical analysis using state-of-the-art generative image models of three families of autophagous loops that differ in how fixed or fresh real training data is available through the generations of training and in whether the samples from previous generation models have been biased to trade off data quality versus diversity. Our primary conclusion across all scenarios is that without enough fresh real data in each generation of an autophagous loop, future generative models are doomed to have their quality (precision) or diversity (recall) progressively decrease. We term this condition Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), making analogy to mad cow disease.},

@article{Yue2024,
   abstract = {X-ray diffraction patterns contain information about the atomistic structure and microstructure (defect population) of materials , extracting detailed information from diffraction patterns is complex, demanding and relies on prior knowledge. We hypothesize that deep-learning techniques can help to perform an effective and accurate analysis with high throughput rates. To demonstrate this concept, we applied a novel deep learning framework to determine the evolution of the β-phase volume fraction in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy during heat-treatment from video sequences of 2D diffraction patterns recorded in transmission and with highly monochromatic radiation in a synchrotron beamline. In particular, we studied the impact of network design on prediction reliability and computational performance. Networks of different architectures were trained using 3008 experimental 2D patterns. A well-tuned model was found to reproduce the phase fractions of another experimental data set, consisting of 1100 diffraction patterns, with a mean-square error as small as 2.6 × 10 −4. The average prediction error of β-phase volume fraction was within 1.6 × 10 −2 (in each diffraction pattern) of the values obtained by conventional methods. Our work demonstrates that convolutional neural networks can evaluate high energy X-ray diffraction patterns with a remarkable level of reliability. Furthermore, it demonstrates the significance of network design on the reliability of predictions and computational performance. The most complex models do not necessarily result in highest accuracy and may even fail to learn from the data.},

@article{Evans2021,
   abstract = {In recent decades, improvements in algorithms, hardware, and theory have enabled crystalline materials to be studied computationally at the atomistic level with great accuracy and speed. To enable dissemination, reproducibility, and reuse, many digital crystal structure databases have been created and curated, ready for comparison with existing infrastructure that stores structural characterizations (e.g., diffraction) of real crystals. Each database will typically have a bespoke, stateless, web-based Application Programming Interface (API); users can submit a query via specially-crafted URLs. Such esoteric and specialized APIs incur maintenance and usability costs upon both the data providers and consumers, who may not be software specialists. The OPTIMADE API specification (Andersen et al., 2020, 2021), released in July 2020, aimed to reduce these costs by designing a common API for use across a consortium of collaborating materials databases and beyond. Whilst based on the robust JSON:API standard (Katz et al., 2015), the OPTIMADE API specification presents several domain-specific features and requirements that can be tricky to implement for non-specialist teams. The repository presented here, optimade-python-tools, provides a modular reference server implementation and a set of associated tools to accelerate the development process for data providers, toolmakers and end-users.},
